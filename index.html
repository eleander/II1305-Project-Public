                <p>Mendi is a brain health system designed for home use. The system consists of three key components: a
                    headset to measure brain activity based on neurofeedback technology, a ‘brain training’ mobile app
                    to help control and enhance brain function in the prefrontal cortex , and intelligent lifestyle
                    content to improve brain health more broadly. For the first time, powerful neurotechnology can be
                    used to take care of your brain health right at home.

            <p>Sprint 1 was dedicated to researching different companies and how they perform export features and how to
                display said data in the form of graphs, pie charts and etc. In addition, Team Gluon had to get to a
                basic understanding on the programming concepts required. Namely APIs, Databases, Front End Languages.
                It was decided that React would be used in order to create a responsive website, Kotlin will be used to
                create an Android app and Swift would be used to create an IOS app.

            <p>Sprint two was dedicated to creating a responsive but static app and learning how to create a responsive
                but static website. Static refers to a lack of connection with a backend API and responsive refers to
                working properly on devices with different screen sizes.
