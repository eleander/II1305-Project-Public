                <p>Mendi is a brain health system designed for home use. The system consists of three key components: a headset to measure brain activity based on neurofeedback technology, a ‘brain training’ mobile app to help control and enhance brain function in the prefrontal cortex , and intelligent lifestyle content to improve brain health more broadly. For the first time, powerful neurotechnology can be used to take care of your brain health right at home.

                <p>Sprint 1 was dedictated to researching different companies and how they perform export features and how to display said data in the form of graphs, pie charts and etc. In addition, Team Gluon had to get to a basic understanding on the programming concepts required. Namely APIs, Databases, Front End Language. It was decided that React would be used in order to create a responsive website, Kotlin will be used to create an Android app and Swift would be used to create an IOS app.
